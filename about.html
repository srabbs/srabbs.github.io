        <p>Hello, my name is srabb and i started programming in gamemaker when i was 12,
            because i wanted to make a jrpg game. I quickly lost interest in that game
            and stopped making it. <br>
            <br>
            I program in C#, Nim and sometimes JavaScript.
            I program in C# using Godot and sometimes Unity. Sometimes, i like to program in Nim
            using NimGL and nimx. I use JavaScript only when i want to be creative and make
            fun little web games and simulations using the p5.js library.
